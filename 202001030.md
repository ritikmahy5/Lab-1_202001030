## Answer of Q1: Identify FRs and NFRs.

### Functional Requirements:
- Allow members to borrow and return books
- Allow library staff to handle day-to-day book transactions
- Allow members to extend the borrowing date of a book
- Allow non-members to browse and search books online
- Allow librarian to enter new records into the system when a new book is purchased, or
remove records when a book is taken off the shelf
- Restrict issuing or returning books to valid members only
- The final deliverable should be a web application that runs only within the institute LAN

### Non-functional Requirements:
- Use recent HTML 5 for the web application
- Ensure that no confidential information (e.g. passwords) is stored in plain text
- Ensure that the system is secure and can protect against unauthorized access.
- Ensure the system is compatible with different browser types.
- Ensure the system is accessible to all members and staff.
- Ensure that the system runs within the institute LAN to reduce security risk
- Ensure that the system iS scalable and can handle a large number of books.
- Ensure that the system is easy to use for members and library staff.
- Ensure the system performance is efficient and fast enough to handle a large number of
users.

## Answer of Q2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

### Scope of the problem
- The goal of this problem is to develop a mobile application that appeals to the requirements of people with disabling hearing loss on a daily basis.
- In order to recognise important sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies, the mobile application will utilise artificial intelligence.

### features of the problem
- Instant alerts for significant sound events of interest 
- Ongoing user sound event logging 
- Low-latency Android optimization for real-time use

### non-functional aspects of the problem
- An intuitive user interface 
- High performance and minimal latency
- High sound recognition accuracy, real-time response, and compatibility with Android devices
- Data security and protection 
- Scalable and flexible enough to accommodate new sound events
- Accessibility for those who are handicapped
- Consistent updates to enhance performance and eliminate bugs.
